# Visualizer
The visualizer this year has Web, MacOS, and Windows builds. See the [releases](https://github.com/MechMania-27/Visualizer/releases) list for the most recent builds.

# Usage
The engine, when run locally, will create a `game.json` file. This is the file you should upload to Visualizer (after starting it up, you will be prompted for a file). To visualize games run non-locally retrieve the game log via `mm logs`.
